# 📘 Graph-Based Model for Trading Using GraphSAINT with Sparse Attention

## 🧩 Introduction

In the fast-paced world of stock market forecasting, understanding inter-stock relationships is key. This project proposes a **hybrid graph-based model** that integrates:

- 🚀 Efficiency of **FastGCN**
- 🎯 Accuracy of **GAT**
- 📈 Scalability of **GraphSAINT**

By combining **GraphSAINT’s subgraph sampling** with a **Sparse Attention mechanism**, we aim to strike the perfect balance between performance and practicality for large-scale trading applications.
