#  Graph-Based Model for Trading Using GraphSAINT with Sparse Attention


##  Introduction

In the fast-paced world of stock market forecasting, understanding inter-stock relationships is key. This project proposes a **hybrid graph-based model** that integrates:

- ðŸš€ Efficiency of **FastGCN**
- ðŸŽ¯ Accuracy of **GAT**
- ðŸ“ˆ Scalability of **GraphSAINT**

By combining **GraphSAINTâ€™s subgraph sampling** with a **Sparse Attention mechanism**, we aim to strike the perfect balance between performance and practicality for large-scale trading applications.

##  Why This Hybrid Model?

###  GraphSAINT Sampling

- Samples subgraphs instead of just nodes/edges
- Efficiently captures local structure
- Drastically reduces memory usage
- Ideal for **large-scale graphs**

###  Sparse Attention

- Focuses only on **significant neighbors**
- Retains **GAT-level accuracy**
- Reduces time and space complexity compared to dense attention mechanisms

##  Use Case: Trading

This model is tailored for real-world trading applications:

- ðŸŽ¯ **Accuracy**: Captures complex interdependencies (e.g., between sectors or ETFs)
- âš¡ **Speed**: Enables real-time signal generation in fast markets
- ðŸ’¾ **Memory Efficiency**: Suitable for edge devices or low-resource deployments

---

##  Conclusion

Our hybrid model achieves:

- âœ… Scalability
- âœ… Accuracy
- âœ… Efficiency

This makes it a **state-of-the-art yet lightweight** approach for predictive modeling in the trading domain.
